# Creating a multiview video playback experience in visionOS

This sample code project demonstrates how to use the multiview video playback APIs using SwiftUI. It illustrates how an app might display video when showing a video in the embedded experience, and how apps might immediately display a video in the expanded experience. From these experiences, someone can enter the multiview video playback experience to display multiple videos simultaneously.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
