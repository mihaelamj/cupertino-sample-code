# Managing location-based reminders
Access reminders set up with geofence-enabled alarms on a person's calendars.

## Overview

With the Reminders app, people can create reminders with alarms based on time and location. When Location Services is turned on, people receive location-based 
reminders when entering or leaving a specified geographic area or geofence. This sample code demonstrates how to add, fetch, complete, remove, filter,
and sort location-based reminders. 

For more information about the sample code and how it works, see [Managing location-based reminders](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit/managing-location-based-reminders).
