# Analyzing a selfie and visualizing its content

The sample demonstrates how to use a [DetectFaceRectanglesRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detectfacerectanglesrequest) to locate all of the faces in a photo. It also shows how to draw boxes around each detected face, outlines around each facial landmark, and a capture-quality score for each selfie.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Analyzing a selfie and visualizing its content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/analyzing-a-selfie-and-visualizing-its-content) in the developer documentation.
