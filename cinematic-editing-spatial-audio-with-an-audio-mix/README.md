# Editing Spatial Audio with an audio mix

Add Spatial Audio editing capabilities with the AudioMix API in the Cinematic framework.

## Overview
Beginning with iPhone 16, you can use Spatial Audio capture to record video with 3D audio, and edit the audio mix in the Photos app. With AudioMix, you have creative control of the background and foreground sounds in a recording. It isolates speech as foreground and ambience as background, and you can select between multiple creative rendering styles to adjust the mix.
The `SpatialAudioCLI` sample project is a command-line tool that demonstrates three different methods for applying an audio mix: using [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer), using [`AVAssetWriter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetwriter), and using [`AUAudioMix`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox/kaudiounitsubtype_auaudiomix).
