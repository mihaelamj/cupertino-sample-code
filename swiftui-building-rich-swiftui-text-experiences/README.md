# Building rich SwiftUI text experiences

Build an editor for formatted text using SwiftUI text editor views and attributed strings.

## Overview

> Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 280: [Code-along: Cook up a rich text experience in SwiftUI with AttributedString](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/280/).

You can follow along with the code written in the WWDC25 session, learning how to upgrade `TextEditor` to rich text, build custom controls, and constrain the formatting options the editor provides.

After the code-along, you can learn more about how to persist rich text using SwiftData, and how to export rich text documents using the `Transferable` protocol.

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1. Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.
