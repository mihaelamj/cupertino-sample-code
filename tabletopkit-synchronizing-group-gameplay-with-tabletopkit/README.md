# Synchronizing group gameplay with TabletopKit

Maintain game state across multiple players in a race to capture all the coins.

## Overview

This sample code project demonstrates how to overcome the difficult task of maintaining a multiplayer game's state in real time. TabletopKit supports automatic game-state synchronization by keeping gameplay items, such as player tokens, dice, coins, and scenery updates --- all with positions and actions --- in sync during a multiplayer game.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Synchronizing group gameplay with TabletopKit][link-to-sample] in the developer documentation.
