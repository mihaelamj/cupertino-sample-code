# Optimizing Map Views with Filtering and Camera Constraints

Display a map that is relevant to the user by filtering points of interest and search results, and constraining the visible region.

## Overview

This sample code demonstrates three features that can make a map relevant to your users:

* Constraining the map view's visible region and zoom to keep the desired areas in view.
* Filtering the points of interest to reduce the clutter on the map view.
* Filtering search result types and points of interest to improve to search and autocompletion.
