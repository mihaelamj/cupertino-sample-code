# Compressing an image using linear algebra

Reduce the storage size of an image using singular value decomposition (SVD).

## Overview

This sample code project decomposes an image into three factors using [singular value decomposition](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValueDecomposition.html) (SVD). The sample compresses an image by computing the products of the factors submatrices. The image below shows two photographs. The first is the original image, and the second is the same image after the sample applies 10:1 compression:  

![Two photographs. The first contains a grayscale image of some flowers. The second shows the same image after compression and shows some degradation and compression artifacts.](Documentation/accelerate-denoising.png)

Any _m_ x _n_ matrix, _A_, has an SVD factorization that decomposes it into three factors:

* The _m_ x _m_  matrix _U_ that contains the left singular vectors of matrix _A_
* The _m_ x _n_  diagonal matrix _Σ_ that contains the [singular values](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValue.html) of matrix _A_, arranged in descending order
* The _n_ x _n_  transposed matrix _V_ that contains the right singular vectors of matrix _A_

The sample uses the Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) function `sgesvdx_` to compute the SVD.

The figure below shows the SVD of a 5 x 3 matrix:

When matrix _A_ contains image information, the magnitude of the singular values correlate to the visual significance of features in the image. 

The sample reduces the storage size of the original image by returning the product of submatrices of _U_, _Σ_, and _Vᵀ_. The sizes of the submatrices derive from the index of the first low singular value. The code in this sample defines that value as `k`. 

For example, if the diagonal elements of _Σ_  are `[2000, 1000, 24]` and you define `k` as `2`, the app keeps `[2000, 1000]` and discards `24`. The following figure shows the matrix multiply function for this example, where the first two singular values contain significant values:

## Create a matrix from the source image

The sample defines a `Matrix` structure that simplifies passing image data to Accelerate's linear algebra libraries.

``` swift
public struct Matrix {
    /// The number of rows in the matrix.
    public let rowCount: Int
    
    /// The number of columns in the matrix.
    public let columnCount: Int
    
    /// The total number of elements in the matrix.
    public var count: Int {
        return rowCount * columnCount
    }
    
    /// A pointer to the matrix's underlying data.
    public var data: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Float> {
        get {
            return dataReference.data
        }
        set {
            dataReference.data = newValue
        }
    }

    /// A pointer to the matrix's underlying data reference.
    private var dataReference: MatrixDataReference
    
    /// An object that wraps the structure's data and provides deallocation when the code releases the structure.
    private class MatrixDataReference {
        var data: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Float>
        
        init(data: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Float>) {
            self.data = data
        }
        
        deinit {
            self.data.deallocate()
        }
    }
}
```

The `Matrix` type provides an initializer that returns a new matrix that contains a 32-bit grayscale copy of the pixel values of a vImage buffer. The `init(cgImage:)` function passes `kvImageNoAllocate` to [`vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage(_:_:_:_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1399118-vimagebuffer_initwithcgimage) and uses the matrix's memory allocation. This ensures that there are no extra bytes at the end of each row. See "Create floating point pixels to use with vDSP" in [Finding the sharpest image in a sequence of captured images](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/finding_the_sharpest_image_in_a_sequence_of_captured_images) for more information on row byte padding.

``` swift
/// The 32-bit planar image format that the `Matrix` type uses to
/// consume and produce `CGImage` instances.
private static var imageFormat = vImage_CGImageFormat(
    bitsPerComponent: 32,
    bitsPerPixel: 32,
    colorSpace: CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceGray(),
    bitmapInfo: CGBitmapInfo(rawValue:
                             kCGBitmapByteOrder32Host.rawValue |
                             CGBitmapInfo.floatComponents.rawValue |
                             CGImageAlphaInfo.none.rawValue))!

/// Converts the specified image to 32-bit planar and returns a new matrix
/// that contains that image data.
public init?(cgImage: CGImage) {
    
    self.init(rowCount: cgImage.height,
              columnCount: cgImage.width)
    
    // Create a `vImage_Buffer` that shares data with `self`.
    var tmpBuffer = vImage_Buffer(
        data: self.data.baseAddress,
        height: vImagePixelCount(self.rowCount),
        width: vImagePixelCount(self.columnCount),
        rowBytes: self.columnCount * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride)
    
    let error = vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage(
        &tmpBuffer,
        &Matrix.imageFormat,
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        cgImage,
        vImage_Flags(kvImageNoAllocate))
    
    if error != kvImageNoError {
        return nil
    }
}
```

The following code creates a matrix instance from a Core Graphics image:

``` swift
guard
    let sourceCGImage = image.cgImage(forProposedRect: nil,
                                      context: nil,
                                      hints: nil),
    let sourceImageMatrix = Matrix(cgImage: sourceCGImage)  else {
    fatalError("Error initializing `SVDImageCompressor` instance.")
}
```

## Create the factor matrices

The `Matrix` type provides an initializer that returns a new zero-filled matrix.

``` swift
/// Returns a zero-filled matrix.
public init(rowCount: Int,
            columnCount: Int) {
    
    let count = rowCount * columnCount
    
    let start = UnsafeMutablePointer<Float>.allocate(capacity: count)
    
    let buffer = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer(start: start,
                                            count: count)
    buffer.initialize(repeating: 0)
    
    self.rowCount = rowCount
    self.columnCount = columnCount
    self.dataReference = MatrixDataReference(data: buffer)
}
```

The following code creates the three matrices that represent the factors:

``` swift
/// The _U_ in _A = U * Σ * Vᵀ_.
let u = Matrix(rowCount: a.rowCount,
               columnCount: k)

/// The diagonal values of _Σ_ in _A = U * Σ * Vᵀ_.
let sigma = Matrix(rowCount: min(a.rowCount, a.columnCount),
                   columnCount: 1)

/// The _Vᵀ_ in _A = U * Σ * Vᵀ_.
let vt = Matrix(rowCount: k,
                columnCount: a.columnCount )
```

## Define the SVD options

The sample requires fully populated _U_ and _Vᵀ_ matrices, and defines the `JOBU` and `JOBVT` parameters that it passes to `sgesvdx_` as `V`. In order to specify that `sgesvdx_` returns a specified number of singular values, the sample defines the `RANGE` parameter as `I`.

``` swift
var JOBU = Int8("V".utf8.first!)
var JOBVT = Int8("V".utf8.first!)
var RANGE = Int8("I".utf8.first!)
```

## Create the workspaces

Before computing the SVD, the sample performs a workspace query to calculate the optimal size of the workspace that `sgesvdx_` requires. The following code specifies `LWORK` as `-1` and passes a pointer to a single `Float` to the `WORK` parameter.

``` swift
var minusOne = __LAPACK_int(-1)
var workspaceDimension = Float()
sgesvdx_(&JOBU,
         &JOBVT,
         &RANGE,
         &m,
         &n,
         aCopy.baseAddress,
         &lda,
         &vl,
         &vu,
         &il,
         &iu,
         &ns,
         sigma.data.baseAddress,
         u.data.baseAddress,
         &ldu,
         vt.data.baseAddress,
         &ldvt,
         &workspaceDimension,
         &minusOne,
         iwork,
         &info)
```

On return, `workspaceDimension` contains the optimal size for the workspace.

The following code allocates the memory that the SVD routine uses as the workspace:

``` swift
var lwork = __LAPACK_int(workspaceDimension)
 
let workspace = UnsafeMutablePointer<Float>.allocate(capacity: Int(lwork))
defer {
    workspace.deallocate()
}
```

## Use LAPACK to compute the SVD

To avoid multiple nested calls to [`withUnsafePointer(to:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafepointer(to:_:)-1wfum), the sample declares variables that shadow some of the matrix properties to pass to the SVD routine as [`UnsafePointer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafepointer) structures.

``` swift
var m = __LAPACK_int(a.m)
var n = __LAPACK_int(a.n)
var lda = __LAPACK_int(a.m)

var ldu = __LAPACK_int(u.m)
var ldvt = __LAPACK_int(vt.m)
```

The samples creates the `iwork` integer array with a count of 12 times the minimum dimension of matrix _A_.

``` swift
let iwork = UnsafeMutablePointer<__LAPACK_int>.allocate(capacity: 12 * Int(min(m, n)))
defer {
    iwork.deallocate()
}
```

The sample calls the LAPACK function for a second time to compute the SVD.

``` swift
// Compute `iu - il + 1` singular values.
sgesvdx_(&JOBU,
         &JOBVT,
         &RANGE,
         &m,
         &n,
         aCopy.baseAddress,
         &lda,
         &vl,
         &vu,
         &il,
         &iu,
         &ns,
         sigma.data.baseAddress,
         u.data.baseAddress,
         &ldu,
         vt.data.baseAddress,
         &ldvt,
         workspace,
         &lwork,
         iwork,
         &info)
```

On return, the matrices `sigma`, `u`, and `vt` contain the SVD result.

## Convert the singular values vector to a matrix

The `sgesvdx_` function computes the singular values as a vector. To convert the vector of `k` diagonal values to a `k * k` diagonal matrix, the `Matrix` type provides an initializer that returns a new matrix from diagonal values.

``` swift
/// Returns a column-major matrix with the specified diagonal elements.
public init<C>(diagonal: C,
               rowCount: Int,
               columnCount: Int)
where
C: Collection,
C.Index == Int,
C.Element == Float {
    
    self.init(rowCount: rowCount,
              columnCount: columnCount)
    
    for i in 0 ..< min(rowCount, columnCount, diagonal.count) {
        self[i * rowCount + i] = diagonal[i]
    }
}
```

The following code creates a `k * k` diagonal matrix from the SVD sigma values:

``` swift
let sigma = Matrix(diagonal: svdResult.sigma.data,
                   rowCount: Int(k),
                   columnCount: Int(k))

```

## Multiply the factors

The `Matrix` type provides a static function that wraps [`cblas_sgemm`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1513264-cblas_sgemm) to multiply two matrices.

``` swift
public static func multiply(a: Matrix,
                            b: Matrix,
                            c: Matrix,
                            k: Int32? = nil) {

    cblas_sgemm(CblasColMajor,
                CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans,
                a.m,
                b.n,
                k ?? b.m,
                1,
                a.data.baseAddress, a.m,
                b.data.baseAddress, b.m,
                0,
                c.data.baseAddress, c.m)
}
```

The sample uses the matrix multiply function to recreate matrix _A_ from the SVD factors.

``` swift
/// The matrix that receives `u * sigma`.
let u_sigma = Matrix(rowCount: svdResult.u.rowCount,
                     columnCount: sigma.columnCount)

Matrix.multiply(a: svdResult.u,
                b: sigma,
                c: u_sigma)

/// The matrix that receives `u * sigma * vᵀ`.
let u_sigma_vt = Matrix(rowCount: u_sigma.rowCount,
                        columnCount: svdResult.vt.columnCount)

Matrix.multiply(a: u_sigma,
                b: svdResult.vt,
                c: u_sigma_vt)
```

## Create a Core Graphics image from the product of the factors

The `cgImage` computed property returns a [`CGImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage) instance from a matrix's data. The computed property creates a temporary vImage buffer that shares its data with the matrix and uses the same planar 32-bit [`vImage_CGImageFormat`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vimage_cgimageformat) that the `init(cgImage:)` initializer uses to convert a Core Graphics image to a matrix.

``` swift
/// Returns a 32-bit per pixel, grayscale `CGImage`instance of the matrix's data.
public var cgImage: CGImage? {
    
    let tmpBuffer = vImage_Buffer(
        data: self.data.baseAddress!,
        height: vImagePixelCount(self.rowCount),
        width: vImagePixelCount(self.columnCount),
        rowBytes: self.columnCount * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride)
    
    return try? tmpBuffer.createCGImage(format: Matrix.imageFormat)
}
```
