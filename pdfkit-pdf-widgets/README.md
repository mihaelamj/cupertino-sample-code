# PDF Widgets 

Demonstrates adding widgets---interactive form elements---to a PDF document.

## Overview

The PDF file format allows for annotations to be associated with a page and a location on that page.
One powerful annotation type is the widget, which represents interactive form elements. PDFKit supports 
three widget types: text, button, and choice widgets. Text widgets are basic text fields. Button 
widgets consist of three subtypes: radio buttons, checkboxes, and push buttons. Choice 
widgets consist of two subtypes: list (a table view) and combo box (a drop-down). This sample 
includes text and button widgets.

## Create Widget Annotations

All widget annotations are instantiated using the 
[`PDFAnnotation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfannotation) constructor with subtype 
[`.widget`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfannotationsubtype/widget). To inform PDFKit
which type of interactive element to add to the document, the `widgetFieldType` property is 
set for each widget:

```swift
// Create a text widget
widgetAnnotation.widgetFieldType = PDFAnnotationWidgetSubtype.text.rawValue
```

```swift
// Create a button widget
widgetAnnotation.widgetFieldType = PDFAnnotationWidgetSubtype.button.rawValue
```

```swift
// Create a choice widget
widgetAnnotation.widgetFieldType = PDFAnnotationWidgetSubtype.choice.rawValue
```

## Set Widget Control Types

Similarly, when creating a button widget annotation, the `widgetControlType` property is set 
to inform PDFKit which type of button to add:

```swift
// Create a radio button
widgetAnnotation.widgetControlType = .radioButtonControl
```

```swift
// Create a checkbox
widgetAnnotation.widgetControlType = .checkBoxControl
```

```swift
// Create a push button
widgetAnnotation.widgetControlType = .pushButtonControl
```

## Choose Widget Control Properties

Toggles for the two kinds of choice widgets are set using the `isListChoice` property 
(list is the default):

```swift
// Create a list choice widget (default)
widgetAnnotation.isListChoice = true
```

```swift
// Create a combo box choice widget
widgetAnnotation.isListChoice = false
```

## Add Widgets to the PDF Page

`ViewController` first loads a URL to the `MyForm.pdf` file through the app's main bundle. This URL
is then used to instantiate a [`PDFDocument`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfdocument).
On success, the document is assigned to the 
[`PDFView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfview) that was
set up in Interface Builder. Once the document has been successfully loaded, The first page can be extracted
so that widget annotations can be added.

`ViewController` adds the following widgets to the extracted 
[`PDFPage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfpage): three text fields, two radio
buttons, three checkboxes, and one push button. 

In addition to basic widget creation, `ViewController` includes a few extra widget-specific properties:

**Text widget properties.** The `textFieldDate` text widget annotation sets two extra properties: `maximumLength` and `hasComb`.
The `maximumLength` property sets the maximum number of characters a user can enter into the text
field. The `hasComb` property, if set, divides the text field into as many equally spaced
positions, or combs, as the value of the maximum length of the field. The `hasComb` property only works
in conjunction with the `maximumLength` property.

The `textFieldMultiline` text widget annotation sets one extra property: `isMultiline`.
By default, all text widget annotations are single line, meaning they don't include word
wrapping. If you want to create a large, multiline text widget with word wrapping, set this
property to `true`.

**Radio widget properties.** The `radioButtonYes` and `radioButtonNo` button widget annotations set two extra properties: `fieldName` and
`buttonWidgetStateString`.
All widgets have their own unique identifier, which is determined by the `fieldName` property. To group widgets---in 
this case the radio buttons---the buttons must have the same
field name, which is set in `ViewController`. To give radio buttons of the same field name
their own unique subidentifier, the `buttonWidgetStateString` property must be set on each, which is also done
in `ViewController`. When the radio buttons are grouped by field name, and each has its own unique 
`buttonWidgetStateString`, they behave like normal radio
buttons (where selecting one deselects others in the group).

- Note: The strings used for both `fieldName` and `buttonWidgetStateString` are arbitrary; what matters is
that `fieldName` is the same for each button, and the `buttonWidgetStateString` strings for each button
are unique to that grouping.

**Button widget properties.** The `resetButton` button widget annotation sets one extra property: [`PDFActionResetForm`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit/pdfactionresetform).
With this property set, the given action is performed when the user clicks (or taps) this
button. The `PDFActionResetForm` action is special in that it clears all widgets
associated with it. `PDFActionResetForm` takes an array of strings that represent widget field names.
The default behavior is to clear all fields included in that array. This behavior can be changed to
clear all widgets not included in the array, by setting the `fieldsIncludedAreCleared`
property to false. Because the behavior to clear all widgets isn't included 
in the list, and no field names were set, this action clears all widgets in the document.
