# Placing entities using head and device transform

This sample code project demonstrates how to create and display content that appears at a person's head location and follows a person's view as they move their head in immersive spaces.
For more information about the app and how it works, see <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/visionos/head-tracking> in the developer documentation.
