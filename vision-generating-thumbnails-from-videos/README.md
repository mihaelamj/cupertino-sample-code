# Generating high-quality thumbnails from videos

Use the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/vision> framework to process images and videos frame by frame, enabling image-analysis requests through <doc://com.apple.documentation/vision/visionrequest>. This sample demonstrates how to process video input to identify the three frames with the highest aesthetic scores, so that you can automatically select the best frames for creating thumbnails and promotional materials, or for highlighting short films.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
[Generating high-quality thumbnails from videos](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/generating-high-quality-thumbnails-from-videos) in the developer documentation.
