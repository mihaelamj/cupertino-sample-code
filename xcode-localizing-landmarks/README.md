# Localizing Landmarks

Add localizations to the Landmarks sample code project.


## Overview
This is an unlocalized version of [Landmarks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-building-an-app-with-liquid-glass). Prepare it for localization by adding a String Catalog and import translations (`de.xcloc`) to complete the localization process.

> Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 225: [Code-along: Explore localization with Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/225).
