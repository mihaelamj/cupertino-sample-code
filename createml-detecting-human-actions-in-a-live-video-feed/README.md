# Detecting human actions in a live video feed

Identify body movements by sending a person's pose data from a series of video 
frames to an action-classification model.

## Overview

This sample app recognizes a person's body moves, called *actions*,
by analyzing a series of video frames with <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/vision>
and predicting the name of the movement by applying an action classifier.
