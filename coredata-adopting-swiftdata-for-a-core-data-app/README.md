# Adopting SwiftData for a Core Data app

Persist data in your app intuitively with the Swift native persistence framework.

## Overview

This sample app showcases how to manage trips using SwiftData and Core Data. It has three versions:

- A Core Data version that demonstrates Core Data best practices.
- A SwiftData version that shows the complete app conversion from Core Data to SwiftData.
- A coexistence version, where the sample app uses Core Data, and adds a widget extension that uses SwiftData. This version covers a scenario where you might want to adopt SwiftData incrementally, or for certain portions of your app.

For more information about the app and how it works, see

in the developer documentation.
