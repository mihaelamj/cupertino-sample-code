# Rendering hover effects in Metal immersive apps

Change the appearance of a rendered onscreen element when a player gazes at it.

In visionOS, both SwiftUI views and RealityKit entities can take advantage of *hover effects*, which change the appearance of a rendered onscreen element when a player gazes at it or highlights it using assistive technologies. In visionOS 26, fully immersive apps that render their own content using Metal can also use hover effects.
