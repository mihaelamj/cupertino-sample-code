# Locating and decoding barcodes in 3D space

This sample code project demonstrates how to use barcode detection in ARKit to detect, decode, and place content near barcodes in your visionOS app.
For more information about the app and how it works, see [Locating and decoding barcodes in 3D space](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/locating-and-decoding-barcodes-in-3d-space) in the developer documentation.

## Configure the sample code project

Replace `Enterprise.license` with your license file. The sample app requires a valid license file to detect barcodes.
