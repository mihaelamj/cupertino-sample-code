# Playing custom audio with your own player

Construct an audio player to play your custom audio data, and optionally take advantage of the advanced features of AirPlay 2.

## Overview

This sample code project builds a robust audio player from the ground up, using the `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` and `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` classes to manage enqueuing and playback of audio that you provide.
