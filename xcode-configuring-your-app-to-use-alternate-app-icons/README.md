# Configuring your app to use alternate app icons
Add alternate app icons to your app, and let people choose which icon to display.

## Overview

The sample code project demonstrates how to configure your app so that people can change the icon that appears on the Home screen, in Spotlight, and elsewhere in the system.

People select an alternate icon in the app interface from a collection that you provide.
