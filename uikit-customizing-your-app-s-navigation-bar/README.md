# Customizing your app's navigation bar

Create custom titles, prompts, and buttons in your app’s navigation bar.

## Overview

Use [`UINavigationBar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar) to display your app's navigational controls in a bar along the top of the iOS device's screen. You can also design a distinctive navigation bar that matches your app’s design and creates intuitive interaction for people.

This sample code project demonstrates how to use [`UINavigationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller) and [`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) classes as building blocks in your application's user interface.

The project walks you through a set of examples that customize the look and behavior of [`UINavigationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller) and [`UINavigationBar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar), including views, prompts, buttons, and titles of your application's navigation bar.

The sample demonstrates different ways to modify the navigation bar indirectly by modifying the view controller's [`UINavigationItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationitem). The levels of customization include applying custom left and right buttons known as [`UIBarButtonItems`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitem).
